## üéä **Current Status: Excellent Foundation**

Our current 105-problem implementation represents a **high-quality, curated selection** of essential algorithmic problems with **world-class implementation standards**.

## üöÄ **Next Phase: Strategic Expansion**

The goal is not to implement all 3,000+ problems immediately, but to **strategically expand to cover the most valuable problems** while maintaining our **exceptional quality standards**.

**Priority Order:**
1. **Essential Interview Problems** (200-300 total)
2. **Algorithm Pattern Completion** (400-500 total)  
3. **Advanced Algorithmic Concepts** (600-800 total)
4. **Comprehensive Coverage** (1000+ total)

This strategic approach ensures we build upon our strong foundation while systematically expanding to create the **ultimate algorithmic learning resource**.
