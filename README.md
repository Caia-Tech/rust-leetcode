## Example Usage

```rust
use rust_leetcode::easy::two_sum::Solution;

let solution = Solution::new();
let result = solution.two_sum(vec![2, 7, 11, 15], 9);
assert_eq!(result, vec![0, 1]);
```

## Approach Philosophy

Each problem includes multiple solutions:
- **Optimal** - The best time/space complexity solution
- **Alternative** - Different approaches with trade-offs
- **Educational** - Suboptimal but instructive implementations

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run property-based tests
cargo test --test property_tests

# Run with specific test filter
cargo test container_with_most_water
```

## Benchmarking

See [README_BENCHMARKS.md](README_BENCHMARKS.md) for detailed benchmarking guide.

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
cargo bench

# Run specific benchmark
cargo bench two_sum
```
